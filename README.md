# Welcome to the (Name) Data User Group!
We are a community of data enthusiasts who meet regularly to share our knowledge, skills and insights on various topics related to data science, analytics, visualization and more. Whether you are a beginner or an expert, a student or a professional, you are welcome to join us and learn from each other.

## About Us

The Data User Group was founded in 2022 by a group of friends who wanted to create a space for data lovers to network, collaborate and have fun. Since then, we have grown to over 100 members from different backgrounds and industries. Our mission is to promote data literacy, foster innovation and support each other in our data journeys.

## Location

We meet every second Wednesday of the month at 6:00 pm at the Data Hub, a co-working space located at 123 Main Street, Downtown. The Data Hub provides us with a comfortable and well-equipped venue for our meetings, as well as access to their data resources and tools.

## Meetings

Our meetings usually last for two hours and consist of two parts: a presentation and a discussion. The presentation is given by one of our members or a guest speaker on a topic of their choice related to data. The discussion is an opportunity for everyone to ask questions, share opinions and exchange ideas on the topic. We also have some time for networking and socializing before and after the meeting.

## Past Topics

- Introduction to Python for Data Analysis
